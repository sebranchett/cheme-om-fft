# FFT analysis check

Tools to read in experimental results files and:
* extract metadata from header
* manipulate columns of data
* perform FFT
* calculate ratio E_ref/E_sample
* calculate ratio delta_E_trts / (delta_E_trts + E_tds)
* plot

Some of these tools contributed to the work done at the TU Delft for [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16740).
